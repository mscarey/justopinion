        of the Court. The court knows of no power in the administrator, by virtue
        of the trust conferred on him by law, to loan the money belonging to the estate
        ; if he does it, he acts upon his own responsibility, and renders himself
        liable to the estate. The note was made to West alone, and for that reason,
        the suit should have been commenced in his name, and a joinder of his co-administrators
        was improper, as no right of action, to recover the amount of the note, existed
        in them. Without determining any other question, for this ground alone, the
        court affirms the judgment,\\nJudgment affirmed.\\nVide Toller\u2019s law
        of executors, page 480, where it is declared, that in equity, an executor
        may be compelled to pay interest, if he suffers the money of the estate to
        lie idle in his hands. This would seem to authorize a loan, or any other investment
        of the trust money.\\nAn administrator is not liable to pay interest upon
        assets in his hands, unless under special circumstances. Dexter v. Arnold,
        et al., 3 Mason, 248.\\nAdmitting that the administrator had no right to loan
        the money, how could the defendant take advantage of it 1 He executed his
        note to the plaintiff as administrator, and to him it was immaterial whether
        he was liable to the administrator personally, or in his representative character.
        Persons interested in the estate might, perhaps, object that the administrator
        had transcended his duty, and might hold him responsible for it; but if they
        are content with his actions it is not easily perceived how the defendant
        can complain.\\nIn Marsh et al. v. The People, 15 Ill., 284, it was held that
        when three were appointed administrators, each was liable for the acts of
        the others. If we are right in the proposition that the defendant could not
        object that the note was not the property of the estate, then it would follow
        that each being liable for the acts of all the others, all would have a right
        to join in an action for the recovery of the money.\",\"type\":\"majority\"}],\"judges\":[],\"head_matter\":\"John
        Thornton and others, Appellants, v. George Smiley and John Bradshaw, Appellees.\\nAPPEAL
        FROM UNION.\\nIf one of two administrators, loans the money of the estate,
        he does it upon his own responsibility, and an action to recover it back,
        should be brought in his own name alone.\\nSmiley and Bradshaw, executed their
        note to Hezekiah West, as administrator of the estate of Weaver, deceased,
        for a sum of money, to recover which this action was brought in the name of
        said West and John Thornton and Mary his wife, late Mary Weaver, who were
        joined with West, in the administration on the estate of Weaver. The money
        was loaned by West alone, to Smiley and Bradshaw, and the note executed to
        him alone as administrator. An objection was made by defendants to the improper
        joinder of parties, which the court sustained, and gave judgment for the defendants.
        To reverse which, the plaintiffs appealed.\"}}}]}"
