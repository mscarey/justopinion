        C. J.\\nThis was an action of debt, brought in the name of the people to the
        use of English, administrator de bonis non of Wilcox, against Marsh, Felt,
        and Mellen, former administrators of Wilcox, and Chandler, Robinson, and Morris,
        their sureties, upon the administration bond. The declaration set forth the
        grant of administration to Marsh, Felt, and Mellen on the 12th of October,
        1839, the execution of the bond in question by the defendants on the same
        day, the revocation of the letters of administration on the 20th of May, 1846,
        and the appointment and qualification of English as administrator de bonis
        non on the 21st of July, 1846 ; and it averred that a large amount of property,
        belonging to the estate of Wilcox, came to the hands of the former administrators
        between the grant and revocation of the letters of administration ; and it
        assigned as breaches of the condition of the bond, the failure of the administrators
        to make an inventory of the property, the conversion of the same to their
        own use, their neglect to collect and pay the debts due to and from the estate,
        and their-refusal to account for and deliver to English the property and effects
        of the estate. The declaration also alleged that Marsh and Felt sold the real
        estate of Wilcox, under a license obtained by them from the circuit court
        in May, 1842; and assigned as a breach of the condition of the bond, their
        refusal to account for and pay over the proceeds to English.\\nThe defendants
        filed several pleas, on some of which issues of fact were formed, and to others
        demurrers were sustained. Of the latter, it will only be necessary to notice
        the 19th and 20th pleas, which were interposed by the defendant Mellen, alone.
        These pleas related only to the breaches assigned for acts done by Marsh and
        Felt subsequent to the 22d of March, 1842, and they alleged in substance,
        that Mellen executed the bond as principal, and not as security for his coadministrator;
        that on the 22d of March, 1842, he tendered his resignation as administrator,
        which was on that day accepted by the probate court; and that he had not since
        intermeddled with the estate.\\nOn the trial, the plaintiff read in evidence
        an order of the probate court, entered on the 22d of March, 1842, accepting
        the written resignation of Mellen as one of the administrators; also an order
        of the same court, entered on the 20th of May, 1846, revoking the letters
        of administration as to Marsh and Felt; also the proceedings in a case of
        the application of Marsh and. Felt for leave to sell the real estate of Wilcox,
        commenced in 1843, \u201E and concluded in 1844, wherein an order of sale
        was made by the circuit court, and under which order Marsh and Felt sold and
        conveyed the real estate; and also the proceedings in several cases in the
        circuit court, commenced by Marsh and Felt as administrators of Wilcox, after
        the 22d of March, 1842, and in which they recovered judgments.\\nOn the foregoing
        and other evidence, the court found the issues for the plaintiff, and assessed
        the damages upon the breaches to $2,204.60; and judgment was rendered against
        the defendants for the penalty of the bond, to be discharged by the payment
        of the damages and costs.\\nFirst. Had the administrator de bonis non the
        right to assign breaches of the condition of the bond ? It was held by this
        court, in Rowan v. Kirkpatrick, 14 Illinois, 1, and Newhall v. Turney, Ib.
        338, that an administrator de bonis non could not compel the personal representative
        of a deceased administrator to account for assets already administered upon;
        but that the creditors or distributees of the estate could alone maintain
        such an action. We are entirely content with the decision made in those cases.
        In both of them an administrator de bonis non had been appointed upon the
        death of the first administrator. It is undoubtedly the law, irrespective
        of statutory regulation, that the authority of an administrator de bonis non
        only extends to such property and effects of the intestate as remain in specie,
        and have not been 'administered by the former administrator. But this principle
        is not applicable to the present case. The statute has prescribed a different
        rule for such cases. The 75th \xA7, ch. 109, R. S., provides : \u201C and
        in all cases where any such executor or administrator shall have his letters
        revoked as aforesaid, he shall, nevertheless, be liable on his bond, to such
        subsequent administrator or administrators, or to any other person or persons
        aggrieved, for any mismanagement of the estate thus committed to his care
        as aforesaid; and such subsequent administrator or administrators may have
        and maintain actions of trover, debt, detinue, account, and on the case, against
        such former executor or administrator, for all such goods, chattels, debts,
        and credits as shall have come to the possession of him or her, and which
        shall be withheld, or may have been wasted, embezzled, or misapplied, and
        no satisfaction made for the same.\u201D This provision enlarges the powers
        of an administrator de bonis non, appointed to succeed an administrator whose
        letters have been revoked. It gives him authority to call upon the removed
        administrator to account fully for his administration of the estate. It expressly
        authorizes him to maintain all necessary actions for the purpose. But this
        provision has no application to the case of the death of the former administrator.
        It leaves such cases to be governed by the rules of the common law. Without
        in the least questioning the propriety of the decisions to which reference
        has been made, we hold th\xE1t where the letters of an administrator are revoked,
        the administrator de bonis non may maintain the appropriate actions against
        him, and compel him not only to account for all the property and. effects
        of the intestate that has come to his hands, but to answer in damages for
        any maladministration of the estate. English, therefore, had the right to
        assign breaches of the bond, and enforce any liability of the former administrators,
        incurred by their laches, fraud, or default in the administration of the estate.\\nSecond.
        Did Mellen cease to be administrator on the acceptance of his resignation
        ? The law in force at the time gave him no right, as a matter of course, to
        resign his trust. Without the sanction of the probate court, his resignation
        would have been unavailing. He would still have been one of the administrators,
        competent to exercise the functions and subject to the responsibilities of
        the office. But we are inclined to hold that the acceptance of his resignation
        by the probate court, amounted to a revocation of the grant of administration
        as to him, and from that time cast upon Marsh and Felt the burden of the administration.
        The court had power to remove him from office, and the acceptance of his resignation
        may be considered as an exercise of that power. The refusal of an administrator
        to perform the duties of his trust, is a sufficient cause for revoking his
        authority, and conferring it upon another; and the removal of one of several
        administrators, without appointing another in his place, devolves upon the
        others the entire management of the estate. The resignation may be regarded
        as a declaration by Mellen that he would no longer participate in the administration
        of the estate, and the acceptance of the resignation by the court as a revocation
        of his authority. In the opinion of the court, Mellen ceased to be administrator
        on the 22d of March, 1842.\\nThird. Is Mellen liable for the acts of Marsh
        and Felt, done after he ceased to be administrator ? The three were appointed
        joint administrators of the estate, and gave a joint bond for the performance
        of their duties. They executed the obligation as principals, and other persons
        became responsible as their sureties. It is clear that Mellen is liable for
        the acts of either, done while they all continued to be administrators. They
        had a joint interest in the property and effects of the estate, and were jointly
        bound to discharge the duties of the trust. Mellen had as much authority over
        the estate as either of the other administrators, and was equally answerable
        for its management. But this common authority and liability ceased on his
        removal from office. His control over the estate was gone, and he ceased to
        be responsible for its future management. All the powers and duties of the
        administration then devolved upon Marsh and Felt, who alone became responsible
        for their exercise. Mellen ought not to- be held liable for their subsequent
        maladministration of the estate. This question arose in the case of Brazer
        v. Clark, 5 Pickering, 96; and it was decided that the estate of a joint executor
        was not liable for the defaults of the surviving executor, arising after the
        death of the former. The court said: \u201C By the tenor of their bond, the
        executors are bound only for the joint executorship ; they may be answerable
        for all defalcations which accrue during that trust, and their estates be
        liable for the deficiencies, notwithstanding they have had no participation
        in the negligence or fraud; but they are not bound in this manner for acts
        or neglects which take place after their power has ceased. The survivor succeeds
        to the whole authority and power, and he alone and those who are sureties
        for him., are responsible.\u201D Again,. \u201C It has been urged, however,
        that Clark\u2019s estate, if not answerable as principal for the default of
        Winship after Clark\u2019s death, is at least liable on the ground of suretyship,
        Clark being to be considered in the light of a surety; but this would be changing
        the character of his engagement. He was principal in the bond and liable as
        such, and when discharged from that liability, he incurred no other;\u201D
        The case of Towne v. Ammidown, 20 Pick. 535, asserts the same doctrine.\\nThe
        court erred in sustaining the demurrers to the nineteenth and twentieth pleas.
        For all defaults in the administration of the estate, happening before the
        22d of March, 1842, Mellen is jointly liable with Marsh and Felt. But for
        those arising subsequent to that time, English must look exclusively to Marsh
        and Felt, and the sureties on the administration bond. Mellen is not liable
        on account of the real estate, for it was converted into assets after the
        determination of his authority.\\nThe judgment must be reversed, and the cause
        remanded.\\nJudgment reversed.\",\"type\":\"majority\"}],\"judges\":[],\"head_matter\":\"Benjamin
